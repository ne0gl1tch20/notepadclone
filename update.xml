    <description>
      - Soft modern rounded UI overhaul across core chrome (tabs, toolbars, menus, docks, status bar, scrollbars)
      - Shared token-based theming now powers main UI, dialogs, Quick Open, AI Chat, and more utility panels
      - Quick Open / Go to Anything expanded with symbols, workspace symbols, background indexing/cache, grouping, and live refresh
      - AI chat productivity upgrades: one-click apply actions, diff preview flow, whole-file replace actions, and safer insert-offer parsing
      - Dialog theming expanded across Settings, Tutorial, Autosave, Workspace dialogs, AI edit preview, Debug Logs, and updater dialogs
      - Added visual UI regression tooling (screenshot smoke tests, HTML manifest, baseline compare/update mode, CI gate)
      - Split UI CI checks into fast, runtime-smoke, and visual-smoke workflows for faster feedback
      - Fixed tab-close hover-mode theming/runtime regressions discovered by new smoke tests
      - Detailed changelog: CHANGELOG.md
