    <description>
      - Expanded Preferences with unified PyPad + N++ compatibility pages and refined Notepad++-style navigation
      - Added user-selectable logging level and broader DEBUG instrumentation (AI chat/controller, updater, autosave, file ops)
      - Debug Logs can now include process-wide console output (root logging + stdout/stderr capture)
      - AI chat now shows OpenAI-style attachment chips and richer apply-flow tracing with correlation IDs
      - AI chat message bubbles now show hover actions (edit/copy for prompts, retry/copy/insert for responses)
      - Editing an older prompt now rewrites that prompt in-place and regenerates from that point with a clear warning
      - AI "replace current tab" offers now ask for confirmation before replacing tab contents
      - Fixed AI chat streaming thread-to-UI callback issue that could cause freezes/closes during replies
      - AI chat auto-scroll now follows new replies only when already near the bottom (send still jumps to latest)
      - Added rich editor right-click context menu with AI/PyPad actions, quick AI row, icons, and style submenu
      - Added runtime hooks for N++ compatibility settings (new doc encoding/EOL, indentation defaults, print templates, link schemes)
      - Improved dialog theming consistency and fixed startup recovery dialog taskbar visibility
      - Detailed changelogs can be found at Changelog.md
